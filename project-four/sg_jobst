Therefore, an optimum design of the nanoantennas and the arrays forming the SLM, such that maximizes the impact of those changes in the optical signal of the device, is necessary to achieve a significant level of modulation. For that aim, DSI seeks a researcher with strong theoretical background and expertise in the design and simulation of active optical antennas and metasurfaces. You should be able to work closely with DSI's experimental team and provide designs, modelling and simulations of the studied nanodevices.Requirements:PhD in Physics/ Engineering or equivalentPossess strong expertise in theory, modelling, design and simulation in nanophotonicsPossess strong background in active and tunable nanoantennas and metasurfacesStrong knowledge of different simulation techniques as well as various analytical approaches in the field of nanophotonicsAbility to perform multi-physics simulations and/ or model processes involving coupled physical phenomena such as electromagnetism, thermal conduction and charge injection and/ or depletion mechanism The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive.

A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samplesLabeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with !Ox fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts ofunlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller modelsCurrent deep learning models have !Os of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are I OOx smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updatesState-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always¬ learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning: Training lB neural networks efficientlyThe high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing  amounts of data and model  size improves performance.

We use GPS/GSM/Accelerometer/WiFi data collected by smartphones or other tracking devices to enable more accurate data collection than traditional methods. Our system consists of an smartphone app that collects sensor data from mobile devices; a backend server that processes the raw data to infer users' stops, activities, and modes of transportation; and a web application that allows users to verify and interact with their processed data in the form of a map and activity timeline. This technology is poised to transform approaches to surveying individuals and households about their travel, activities and lifestyles, and help transportation agencies, companies, and researchers make better decisions for planning and management. The FMS technology is also being extended to conduct real time surveys, stated preferences surveys, provide feedback and trip planning information to users etc. Another important extension of FMS is FMS-Freight, which is an innovative commodity flow survey system that collects establishment, shipment and vehicle information in an automated and integrated way.  ResponsibilitiesUnder limited supervision, the Research Scientist is expected to take management responsibility for the project and play a main role in research, implementation, and survey coordination activities. The candidate will participate in proposal writing; interact with multiple partners and stakeholders. The candidate is also expected to contribute to official project reports, supervise students, software engineers and researchers working on the project, regularly meet with supervisors, and disseminate research findings in journals and conferences.  RequirementsWe are looking for exceptional candidates with strong backgrounds in relevant areas including:PhD in Computer Science, Transportation or related disciplinesExperience in managing research projects.Independent and self-motivated, yet able to work as part of a multidisciplinary team.Experience in software development, modeling, data analysis and/or visualization is preferredExperience in writing research publicationsGood analytical, communications, and interpersonal skillsGood command of written and spoken EnglishThe position will be based at the SMART FM Offices on the new campus of the National University of Singapore (NUS), with the possibility of travelling to MIT (for up to a few months) as part of the international collaboration.
